# docker-gs-ping-roach
 
A slightly more advanced Go server/microservice example for [Docker's Go Language Guide](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/). 

Notable features:

* Extends the basic example introduced in [olliefr/docker-gs-ping](https://github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping).
* Uses [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) database engine.
* Introduces [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Contributing

This was written for an _introduction_ section of the Docker tutorial and as such it favours brevity and pedagogical clarity over robustness. 

Thus, feedback is welcome, but please no nits or pedantry. Ain't nobody got time for that ðŸ™ƒ
